Redesign bc website

After I finished the frameworks study, I decided to redesign a website. I wanted to practise the new knowledges and ux design. I picked the Catalunya's library or BC because your webspage is old-fashioned.  The original bc's website is very complex and it's easy to get lose. The challenge was change the structure and make it more intuitive. The style was make with bootstrap in order to get more dinamisn. In the design process the references were the Oxford's library and Boston's public library.
